# Chapter Three

## 3.1. Static Testing Basics

### 3.1.1. Work Products Examined by Static Testing
> Almost all work products can be examined using Static Testing, including: (they need some sort of reference for that)
1. requirements specifications documents,
1. source code,
1. test plans,
1. test cases,
1. product backlog items,
1. test charters,
1. project documentation,
1. contracts & models.

> Work products that cannot be examine via Static Testing: *3rd party executable code (due to legal reasons)*.

### 3.1.2. Value of Static Testing
> Static testing can detect defects in the earliest phases of SDLC; fulfilling the principle of early testing.
> Static testing can detect defects that cannot be detected by dynamic testing like:
1. unreachable code,
1. design patterns not implemented as desired,
1. defects in non-executable work products.

> Static testing provides the ability to *evaluate the quality of + build confidence in* work products.
> By verifying the documented requirements, the stakeholders can make sure that deez requirements describe their actual needs. (creating a shared understanding among them + improved communication); this is why **it is important to involve stakeholders in static analysis.**

> Even if reviews can be costly to implement, they are cheaper overall than when no reviews are implement them (because of the time/effort/cost to fix defect later and yadeyadeyada)

> *Code defects* can be detected **much more efficiently** than in dynamic testing.

### 3.1.3. Differences Between Static Testing & Dynamic Testing
1. Static & Dynamic testing can both lead to detection of defects, *but there are some defects that can only be found only via static testing or dynamic testing.*
1. Static testing *finds defects directly*, while dynamic testing *causes failures from which the associated defects are determined through subsequent analysis*.
1. Static testing may more easily detect defects that *lay on paths through the code that are rarely executed or hard to reach* using dynamic testing.
1. Static testing **can be** applied to *non-executable work products*, while dynamic testing **can ONLY be** applied to *executable work products.*
1. Static testing can be used to *measure quality characteristics* that are **not dependent on executing code** (like maintainability), while dynamic testing can be used to *measure quality characteristics* that are **dependent on executing code** (like performance efficiency).

> Defects that are easier/cheaper to find through static testing:
1. Defects in **requirements** (inconsistencies, ambiguities, contradictions, omissions, inaccuracies, duplications)
1. Defects in **design** (inefficient database structures, poor modularization)
1. Defects in **code** (variables with undefined values, undeclared variables, unreachable/duplicated code, excessive code complexity)
1. **Deviations from standards** (not sticking to a naming convention)
1. **Incorrect interface specs [?!!]** (mismatched number, type, order of parameters)
1. **Specific types of security vulnerabilities** (buffer overflows)
1. **Gaps/inaccuracies in test basis coverage** (missing tests for an acceptance criterion)

## 3.2. Feedback and Review Process
### 3.2.1. Benefits of Early and Frequent Stakeholder Feedback
> If there is little stakeholder involvement during SDLC:
1. the product being developed might not meet the stakeholders' expectations,
> Failing to deliver to stakeholders can result in:
1. costly rework,
1. missed deadlines,
1. blame games,
1. might even lead to an epic project failure.

> Frequent stakeholder feedback can prevent misunderstandings about requirements and ensure that changes to requirements are understood and implemented earlier.

### 3.2.2. Review Process Activities
