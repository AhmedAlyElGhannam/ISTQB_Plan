# ISTQB CTFL Preparation Plan
This repository contains my preparation plan for ISTQB's CTFL exam. I took this exam as a part of my journey in Information Technology Institute (ITI)'s Embedded Systems Training Program. You will find: \

1. Timeline for studying.
2. Sample exams with their official answers.
3. CTFL v4.0 syllabus if you are lazy and do not want to download it from their website.
4. Notes I took while studying. \

This repo was made for me and my study partner to ease our lives but, since I have passed the exam successfully, I decided to clean it up a bit because there is a tiny chance it might help someone preparing for this exam. Good luck! :)
